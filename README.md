# Neverending To Do App

Not nearly as cool as The Neverending Story.

This is what happens when you're brushing up on your Node skills, but you're really a front end dev, so you try to be judicious about your back end code, but just go to town on the front end.

## Notes

### 02-07-2025

Okay I added the client side. It's React + Typescript with some react-hook-form and Chakra UI mixed in because I'm not reinventing the wheel here. Yes, I did chose a pink color scheme.

If you want to run the app, you'll have to set up your own database and add your own .env file.

If you want to run the server side unit tests, I've been using a separate test database and corresponding .env.test file.

I'll add front end tests later. It's the last thing I'm going to do, lol, pun very much intended.

### 01-07-202

I'm not even going to commit the client side stuff yet. It's such a beast.
